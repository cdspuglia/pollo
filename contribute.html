        <p>
            If you are reading this page...great! You're our hero! We really appreciate contributions from anyone
            and we are looking forward to accept your pull requests.
        </p>

        <h3>How to contribute</h3>
        <p>
            For quick bug fixing and other suggestions, just use the repository issue tracker.
            If you want to actually work on some features, instead, we suggest you to take a look at the
            <a href="development.html">development guidelines</a> first, then browse the <a href="#">backlog</a> to see what you can do and
            who you have to collaborate with, if working on a same feature.
        </p>

        <h3>I have some code ready to be merged. What now?</h3>
        <p>
            Great! Just open a pull request in the Pollo repository and wait for some of our core team to
            review your code. We could ask you to squash your commits in a unique one before merging, as we try
            to keep git history as clean as possible.
        </p>

        <h3>I still have doubts on what to do or how to do things...</h3>
        <p>
            No problems, just drop a message in our <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Club-degli-Sviluppatori-Puglia-5023541">LinkedIn group</a>,
            we will reply to you in no time (we know, it's an Italian group, but feel free to use English, of course).
